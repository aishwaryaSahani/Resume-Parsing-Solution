# Resume-Parsing-Solution
Whenever we apply to a job, we submit our resume. Along with that we also fill out an application form. Most of the times, the application forms ask for the information in the resume. Thus, the user must manually fill out this form. Also, recruiters receive resumes from numerous candidates. In order to screen them, they must manually go through every resume. They must filter through the under qualified and not suitable candidates. This is unnecessarily time consuming for the recruiters as well as candidates. What if we could automate the process? Rather than manually going through the resumes word by word, let a software do it for them. This is called as resume parsing.
